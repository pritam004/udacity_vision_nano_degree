# Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Assignments and Notebooks

This repository contains all the notebooks and assignments I solved as a part of the computer vision nanodegree on udacity.


I will add as and when I do it


## 1st week  Image Representation & Classification

1. Introduction

2. Open cv primitives

3. changing background with green screen


## 2nd week  Convolutional Filters and Edge Detection

1. Filters 

    a. sobel filters (detecting edges and direction)

    b. gaussian blur (low pass filter)

    c. laplacian (high pass filter)

2. Canny edge detector [notes in copy]

3. Hough transform (line detector)

4. Haar Cascades and object recognition (multiple face detection in an image )

## week 3 Types of Features & Image Segmentation

1. Harris Corner Detection

2. dialation

3. errotion

4. contours [boundary and angles]

5. kmeans for segmentation
